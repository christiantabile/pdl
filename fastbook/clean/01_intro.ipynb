    "### Limitations Inherent To Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "From this picture we can now see some fundamental things about training a deep learning model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A model cannot be created without data.\n",
    "- A model can only learn to operate on the patterns seen in the input data used to train it.\n",
    "- This learning approach only creates *predictions*, not recommended *actions*.\n",
    "- It's not enough to just have examples of input data; we need *labels* for that data too (e.g., pictures of dogs and cats aren't enough to train a model; we need a label for each one, saying which ones are dogs, and which are cats).\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, we've seen that most organizations that say they don't have enough data, actually mean they don't have enough *labeled* data. If any organization is interested in doing something in practice with a model, then presumably they have some inputs they plan to run their model against. And presumably they've been doing that some other way for a while (e.g., manually, or with some heuristic program), so they have data from those processes! For instance, a radiology practice will almost certainly have an archive of medical scans (since they need to be able to check how their patients are progressing over time), but those scans may not have structured labels containing a list of diagnoses or interventions (since radiologists generally create free-text natural language reports, not structured data). We'll be discussing labeling approaches a lot in this book, because it's such an important issue in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these kinds of machine learning models can only make *predictions* (i.e., attempt to replicate labels), this can result in a significant gap between organizational goals and model capabilities. For instance, in this book you'll learn how to create a *recommendation system* that can predict what products a user might purchase. This is often used in e-commerce, such as to customize products shown on a home page by showing the highest-ranked items. But such a model is generally created by looking at a user and their buying history (*inputs*) and what they went on to buy or look at (*labels*), which means that the model is likely to tell you about products the user already has or already knows about, rather than new products that they are most likely to be interested in hearing about. That's very different to what, say, an expert at your local bookseller might do, where they ask questions to figure out your taste, and then tell you about authors or series that you've never heard of before."

    "1. What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?\n",
    "> Early enthusiasts gave up on neural networks after the 1969 book, <em>Perceptrons</em>, stated that a single layer of the device was unable to learn simple, yet critical mathematical functions. Although this was possible if more layers were added (which they did state) it went unrecognized until the 80's when the addition of more layers was being explored. Although more layers did improve performance, the networks became large, slow, and costly and again were not recognized until technology was able to support such system.\n",
    "1. What is a GPU?\n",
    ">A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or better known as a 'Graphics Card', is a circuitry device in a computer that is used to handle thousands of instructions/tasks (usually 3D rendered objects for modeling/gaming).

Most likely not because for us humans this all occurs subconciously. Attempting to code every step in minute detail would be a challenge for programmers, which is why alternative learning methods are used.\n",

    "1. What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called \"weights\"?\n",

    "1. Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?\n",
    ">The complexity of a deep learning model makes it very difficult to understand why a neural network makes a given prediction because it's a network of many different neurons of many layers, all interconnected. This is why we are so interested in the 'weights', since that gives us a slight understanding of how the model behaves.\n",

    "1. What is the difference between classification and regression?\n",

    ">Regression: a model that aatemps to predict one or more numeric quantities (temperature, location coordinates).\n",
    "1. What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?\n",
    ">A 'validation set' is 20% of the dataset not used in training the mode, but instead to measure accuracy of the model on unseen data after it has been fit.\n",
    "1. What will fastai do if you don't provide a validation set?\n",
    ">fastai will automatically reserve 20% of the dataset and provide a 'validation set' (valid_pct = 0.2 by default).\n",
    "1. Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?\n",
    ">It depends on what the model is being used for, if the validation set is not representative of new data it would see, a random sample is not recommended.\n",
    "1. What is overfitting? Provide an example.\n",
    ">Overfitting refers to when the model fits too closely to a limited data set (aka, it 'memorises' the dataset) and performs poorly on unseed data.\n",
    "1. What is a metric? How does it differ from \"loss\"?\n",
    ">Metric: a function that measures the quality of the resulting prediction using the 'validation set'. Returns human interpretable statistics that help to understand how the model is performing.\n",
    ">Loss: an optimization algorithm used in the architechture (specifically the SGD) to calculate performance to update the model parameters accordingly.\n",
    "1. How can pretrained models help?\n",
    ">Pretrained models validate that your model is already capable (is has already been trained on some dataset) and allows for more accurate and faster testing, with less data at a cost of less time and money.\n",

    "1. What is segmentation?\n",
    ">A pixelwise classification problem. In deep learning, a model is created that can label the content of every individual pixel in an image/video.

    "1. What is `y_range` used for? When do we need it?\n",
